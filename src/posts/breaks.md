## Where does this come from

Recently, I moved from Spain to Germany to start my studies at Technical University of Munich, and at an initial point, I had already set my plan of not only start grinding like a demon during my stay in Germany, but also to connect and learn from as much people as possible.

The reality is, however, quite different. At the end, just a few days after arriving to Munich, I started working on some stuff, while I was also handling some initial paperwork and trying to adapt to this new life style. From the first moment, I noticed that something was off, I couldn't just focus for an entire day over and over again.

Luckily, I started taking some walks, strolling around the city and exploring all what it had. From impressive buildings, to massive gardens and lots of wonderful churches that leave you with a neck pain after having to look up for a lot of time.

I took the opportunity to bring the camera and start shooting to whatever I saw. That is when something started to change inside me. In a span of a few days, I began feeling that creative tasks, those that always hated, were somehow easier on my brain than spending the whole day reading, learning and doing stuff. Then I understood it, it wasn't that I had developed some new skill, it was that my body, tired of those intense work sessions, was just tired of it. It was asking for a break, a moment of peace, and the fact that the Englischer Garten is another level of relaxing, combined with the opportunity of finally unleashing some creativity, was what my body was asking for such a long time.

I am writing this to myself, to remind me that I do not need to be a machine that works non-stop(computers are designed for that). I can relax a bit, and **just be who I am**. Invest some time in my preferred hobbies, and let my mind be free for a while, not worried of that *X* is not working or that *Y* needs to be done.
